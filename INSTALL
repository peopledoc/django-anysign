`django-anysign` is open-source software, published under BSD license.
See :doc:`/about/license` for details.

.. note::

   If you want to install a development environment, you should go to
   :doc:`/contributing` documentation.


************
Requirements
************

`django-anysign` has been tested against `Python`_ 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Other
versions may work, but they are not part of the test suite at the moment.

Installing `django-anysign` will automatically trigger the installation of the
following requirements:

.. literalinclude:: /../setup.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: BEGIN requirements
   :end-before: END requirements


************
As a library
************

In most cases, you will use `django-anysign` as a dependency of another
project. In such a case, you should add ``django-anysign`` in your main
project's requirements. Typically in :file:`setup.py`:

.. code:: python

   from setuptools import setup

   setup(
       install_requires=[
           'django-anysign',
           #...
       ]
       # ...
   )

Then when you install your main project with your favorite package manager
(like `pip`_), `django-anysign` and its recursive dependencies will
automatically be installed.


**********
Standalone
**********

You can install `django-anysign` with your favorite Python package manager.
As an example with `pip`_:

.. code:: sh

   pip install django-anysign


*****
Check
*****

Check `django-anysign` has been installed:

.. code:: sh

   python -c "import django_anysign;print(django_anysign.__version__)"

You should get installed `django_anysign`'s version.
