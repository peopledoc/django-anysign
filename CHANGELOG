This document describes changes between each past release. For information
about future releases, check `milestones`_ and :doc:`/about/vision`.


1.0 (2016-07-18)
----------------

- Feature #21 - Drop support of Django 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7
  Explicitly mark Django 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 as not supported
  (tests fail with those versions) in packaging.

- Add support of Django 1.9.

- Breaking: `django_anysign.api` package is no longer imported in
  `django_anysign` root package, as it is not compatible with Django 1.9.
  Instead of doing ``import django_anysign``, just do:
  ``from django_anysign import api as django_anysign``.

- Feature #24 - Use django UUIDField instead of uuidfield external app.


0.4 (2015-06-25)
----------------

Workaround identifiers and Django version.

- Features #7 and #8 - ``Signature`` and ``Signer`` models have
  ``anysign_internal_id`` attribute. It is an unique identifier for signature
  or signer on Django side. For use as a "foreign key" in backend's database,
  whenever possible. It defaults to an UUID. You may override it with a custom
  property if your models already have some UUID.

- Feature #5 - ``Signer`` model has ``signature_backend_id`` attribute. Use it
  to store the backend's signer identifier, i.e. signer's identifier in
  external database.

- Refactoring #15 - Project repository moved to github.com/novafloss (was
  github.com/novapost).

- Refactoring #18 - Tox runs tests for multiple Django version.

- Features #16 and #17 - Tests include Django version 1.7 and 1.8.


0.3 (2014-10-08)
----------------

Signers' ordering.

- Feature #4 - Added ``signing_order`` attribute to ``Signer`` model.


0.2 (2014-09-12)
----------------

Minor fixes.

- Feature #2 - Explicitely mark Django 1.7 as not supported (tests fail with
  Django 1.7) in packaging.

- Bug #3 - Fixed wrong usage of `django-anysign` API in `django-dummysign`
  backend.


0.1 (2014-08-11)
----------------

Initial release.

- Introduced base model ``SignatureType`` and base model factories
  ``SignatureFactory`` and ``SignerFactory``.

- Introduced base backend class ``SignatureBackend``.

- Introduced loaders for custom models and backend:
  ``get_signature_backend_instance``, ``get_signature_type_model``,
  ``get_signature_model`` and ``get_signer_model``.
